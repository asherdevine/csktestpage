Some are there also just for participation, which can prove to be very important for them. Additionally, for children in primary school who have siblings with disabilities, we provide more advanced classes.</p>

                <p data-i18n="programs_practical_text1">Multiple practical formation programs run for our members. With the most recent addition being an adapted formation in gardening at the Ecole Jardinage Med-o-Med Bouregreg. This takes place twice a week, where a group of 12 young adults learn and most importantly put into practice the traits of gardening.</p>
                <p data-i18n="programs_practical_text2">Another practical program we are running is to teach children to make sandwiches. This is not happening on a consistent basis yet, but it will in 2025. It will also be used to contribute to provide food for the activities that need to be combined with eating (gardening for instance). But it is also aimed to serve to be able to sell sandwiches in the near future.</p>

                <h4 class="mb-4 mt-5" data-i18n="programs_social_title">Social Outing Programs</h4>
                <p data-i18n="programs_social_text1">We have monthly social outing programs for pretty much all of our members. The most common way we do this is by going to the Hilton Park, where our members can enjoy breakfast, fellowship, sports, painting, music and meeting many people that are connected to our association. It is a great way to introduce new people to our association in an informal setting. Volunteers also can be actively involved in these outings.</p>
                <p data-i18n="programs_social_text2">We also have the habit of going to the countryside of Arjet, to visit a nice farm where all our members can come to. We have our own tables and chairs and party tents stocked up there to accommodate such a big group of around 100 people. This is a wonderful occasion to cook, eat, dance, play and interact with each other. Both these activities do take up quite some bus rides to have all the members participate, but it is more than worth it.</p>

                <p data-i18n="programs_therapy_text">For our physical therapy services, children with disabilities (mostly under age 12 years) and their mothers come in the morning twice a week for 2–3-hour sessions of physical therapy, playing, social interaction and loving care. We encourage mothers to take initiative for the exercises of their children and provide training advice.</p>

                <h4 class="mb-4 mt-5" data-i18n="programs_swimming_title">Swimming</h4>
                <p data-i18n="programs_swimming_text">Since 2010 swimming has been a key program on our agenda. Twice per week, 25-35 children have a swimming activity. One at the Mohammed VI Handicapped Center in Salé for an hour and the other one at the Rabat American School. This is followed with coffee afterwards and being able to socialize. We have a group of volunteers (mothers, locals and internationals) as well as staff who work with the children in groups and one-on-one. The mothers get the chance to come along and watch the children enjoy the experience and improve their swimming skills. The children have the opportunity to earn diplomas through swimming activities and compete in swim matches a few times a year.</p>

                <p data-i18n="programs_horse_text">What started with a small group of 8 children having a weekly horse ride session, has grown into a weekly horse ride session available to a weekly group from up to 25 kids. They make use of horses and ponies. This way even the severely are able to participate in this program. And many of the members start at the ponies and eventually are able to move over to the big horses. It is also wonderful to see the bond between the children and the animals grow. We are very thankful to the horse-riding school at the Royal Complexe des Sports Equestres Dar Es Salam for giving us this great opportunity. It has proven to be a great program for mothers, volunteers and visitors to participate in as well.</p>

It's a great way to warm up before swimming, and easily accessible for many children. It also lets children interact with each other and it's a sport in which they can easily become better at, so it's quite motivating to play.</p>

They have various things they do together among which are: making creative articles (keychains, purses, clothes etc.) that can be sold, and cooking things together, attending bazaars and other social programs.</p>
